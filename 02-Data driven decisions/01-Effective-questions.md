# Introduction to problem-solving and effective questioning
Welcome to the second course in the Google Data Analytics certificate. If you completed Course One, we met briefly at the beginning, but for those of you who are just joining us, my name is Ximena, and I'm a Google Finance data analyst. I think it's really wonderful that you're here with me learning about the fascinating field of data analytics. Learning and education have always been very important to me. When I was young, my mom always said, "I can't leave you an inheritance, but I can give you an education that opens doors." That always pushed me to keep learning, and that education gave me the confidence to apply for my job at Google. Now I get to do really meaningful work every day. Just recently I worked as an analyst on a team called Verily Life Sciences. We were helping to get life-saving medical supplies to those who need it most. To do this, we forecasted what health care professionals would need on hand and then shared that information with networks. The information that my team provided helped make data driven decisions that actually saved lives. I'm thrilled to be your instructor for this course. We're going to talk about the difference between effective and ineffective questions and learn how to ask great questions that lead to insights that can help you solve business problems. You will discover that effective questions help you to make the most of all the data analysis phases. You may remember that these phases include ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. In the ask step, we define the problem we're solving and make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. This will help keep you focused on the actual problem, which leads to more successful outcomes. So we'll begin this course by talking about problem solving and some of the common types of business problems that data analysts help solve. And because this course focuses on the ask phase, you'll learn how to craft effective questions that help you collect the right data to solve those problems. Next, we'll talk about the many different types of data. You'll learn how and when each is the most useful. You'll also get a chance to explore spreadsheets further and discover how they can help make your data analysis even more effective. And then we'll start learning about structured thinking. Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options. In this process, you address a vague, complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, and then those steps lead you to a logical solution. We'll work together to be sure you fully understand how to use structured thinking and data analysis. Finally, we'll learn some proven strategies for communicating with others effectively. I can't wait to share more about my passion for data analytics with you, so let's get started.

# Data in action
In this video, I'm going to share an interesting data analytics case study, it will illustrate how problem solving relates to each phase of the data analysis process and shed some light on how these phases work in the real world. It's about a small business that used data to solve a unique problem it was facing. The business is called Anywhere Gaming Repair. It's a service provider that comes to you to fix your broken video game systems or accessories. The owner wanted to expand his business. He knew advertising is a proven way to get more customers, but he wasn't sure where to start. There are all kinds of different advertising strategies, including print, billboards, TV commercials, public transportation, podcasts, and radio. One of the key things to think about when choosing an advertising method is your target audience, in other words, the specific people you're trying to reach. For example, if a medical equipment manufacturer wanted to reach doctors, placing an ad in a health magazine would be a smart choice. Or if a catering company wanted to find new cooks, it might advertise using a poster at a bus stop near a cooking school. Both of these are great ways to get your ad seen by your target audience. The second thing to think about is your budget and how much the different advertising methods will cost. For instance, a TV ad is likely to be more expensive than a radio ad. A large billboard will probably cost more than a small poster on the back of a city bus. The business owner asked a data analyst, Maria, to make a recommendation. She started with the first step in the data analysis process, Ask. Maria began by defining the problem that needed to be solved. To do this, she first had to zoom out and look at the whole situation in context. That way she could be sure that she was focusing on the real problem and not just its symptoms. This leads us to another important part of the problem solving process, collaborating with stakeholders and understanding their needs. For Anywhere Gaming Repair, stakeholders included the owner, the vice president of communications, and the director of marketing and finance. Working together, Maria and the stakeholders agreed on the problem, not knowing their target audience's preferred type of advertising. Next step was the prepare phase, where Maria collected data for the upcoming analysis process. But first, she needed to better understand the company's target audience, people with video game systems. After that, Maria collected data on the different advertising methods. This way, she would be able to determine which was the most popular one with the company's target audience. Then she moved on to the process step. Here Maria cleaned the data to eliminate any errors or inaccuracies that could get in the way of the result. As we've learned, when you clean data, you transform it into a more useful format, create more complete information and remove outliers. Then it was time to analyze. In this step, Maria wanted to find out two things. First, who's most likely to own a video gaming system? Second, where are these people most likely to see an advertisement? Maria, first discovered that people between the ages of 18 and 34 are most likely to make video game related purchases. She could confirm that Anywhere Gaming Repair's target audience was people 18-34 years old. This was who they should be trying to reach. With this in mind, Maria then learned that both TV commercials and podcasts are very popular with people in the target audience. Because Maria knew Anywhere Gaming Repair had a limited budget and understanding the high cost of TV commercials, her recommendation was to advertise in podcasts because they are more cost-effective. Now that she had her analysis, it was time for Maria to share her recommendation so the company could make a data driven decision. She summarized her results using clear and compelling visuals of the analysis. This helped her stakeholders understand the solution to the original problem. Finally, Anywhere Gaming Repair took action, they worked with a local podcast production agency to create a 30 second ad about their services. The ad ran on podcast for a month, and it worked. They saw an increase in customers after just the first week. By the end of week 4, they had 85 new customers. There you go. Effective problem solving using data analysis phases in action. Now, you've seen how the six phases of data analysis can be applied to problem solving and how you can use that to solve real world problems.

# From issue to action: The six data analysis phases
There are six data analysis phases that will help you make seamless decisions: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Keep in mind, these are different from the data life cycle, which describes the changes data goes through over its lifetime. Let’s walk through the steps to see how they can help you solve problems you might face on the job.

Icon of a question mark with the word ask
Step 1: Ask
It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:

Define the problem you’re trying to solve

Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?

Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?


Icon of a clipboard with the word prepare
Step 2: Prepare
You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide:

What metrics to measure

Locate data in your database

Create security measures to protect that data

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?

What research do I need to do?


Icon of numbers with the word process
Step 3: Process
Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data

Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces

Removing repeated entries

Checking as much as possible for bias in the data

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?

How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?


Icon of magnifying glass with the word analyze
Step 4: Analyze
You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to:

Perform calculations

Combine data from multiple sources

Create tables with your results

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
What story is my data telling me?

How will my data help me solve this problem?

Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?


Icon of an arrow with the word share
Step 5: Share
Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  

Make better decisions

Make more informed decisions

Lead to stronger outcomes

Successfully communicate your findings

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?

What would help me understand this if I were the listener?


Icon of finger pressing on a button with the word act
Step 6: Act
Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called structured thinking. This process involves four basic activities:

Recognizing the current problem or situation

Organizing available information

Revealing gaps and opportunities

Identifying your options

When you are starting out in your career as a data analyst, it is normal to feel pulled in a few different directions with your role and expectations. Following processes like the ones outlined here and using structured thinking skills can help get you back on track, fill in any gaps and let you know exactly what you need.

# Common problem types
In a previous video, I shared how data analysis helped a company figure out where to advertise its services. An important part of this process was strong problem-solving skills. As a data analyst, you'll find that problems are at the center of what you do every single day, but that's a good thing. Think of problems as opportunities to put your skills to work and find creative and insightful solutions. Problems can be small or large, simple or complex, no problem is like another and they all require a slightly different approach but the first step is always the same: Understanding what kind of problem you're trying to solve and that's what we're going to talk about now. Data analysts work with a variety of problems. In this video, we're going to focus on six common types. These include: making predictions, categorizing things, spotting something unusual, identifying themes, discovering connections, and finding patterns. Let's define each of these now. First, making predictions. This problem type involves using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future. For example, a hospital system might use a remote patient monitoring to predict health events for chronically ill patients. The patients would take their health vitals at home every day, and that information combined with data about their age, risk factors, and other important details could enable the hospital's algorithm to predict future health problems and even reduce future hospitalizations. The next problem type is categorizing things. This means assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features. An example of this problem type is a manufacturer that reviews data on shop floor employee performance. An analyst may create a group for employees who are most and least effective at engineering. A group for employees who are most and least effective at repair and maintenance, most and least effective at assembly, and many more groups or clusters. Next, we have spotting something unusual. In this problem type, data analysts identify data that is different from the norm. An instance of spotting something unusual in the real world is a school system that has a sudden increase in the number of students registered, maybe as big as a 30 percent jump in the number of students. A data analyst might look into this upswing and discover that several new apartment complexes had been built in the school district earlier that year. They could use this analysis to make sure the school has enough resources to handle the additional students. Identifying themes is the next problem type. Identifying themes takes categorization as a step further by grouping information into broader concepts. Going back to our manufacturer that has just reviewed data on the shop floor employees. First, these people are grouped by types and tasks. But now a data analyst could take those categories and group them into the broader concept of low productivity and high productivity. This would make it possible for the business to see who is most and least productive, in order to reward top performers and provide additional support to those workers who need more training. Now, the problem type of discovering connections enables data analysts to find similar challenges faced by different entities, and then combine data and insights to address them. Here's what I mean; say a scooter company is experiencing an issue with the wheels it gets from its wheel supplier. That company would have to stop production until it could get safe, quality wheels back in stock. But meanwhile, the wheel companies encountering the problem with the rubber it uses to make wheels, turns out its rubber supplier could not find the right materials either. If all of these entities could talk about the problems they're facing and share data openly, they would find a lot of similar challenges and better yet, be able to collaborate to find a solution. The final problem type is finding patterns. Data analysts use data to find patterns by using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again. Ecommerce companies use data to find patterns all the time. Data analysts look at transaction data to understand customer buying habits at certain points in time throughout the year. They may find that customers buy more canned goods right before a hurricane, or they purchase fewer cold-weather accessories like hats and gloves during warmer months. The ecommerce companies can use these insights to make sure they stock the right amount of products at these key times. Alright, you've now learned six basic problem types that data analysts typically face. As a future data analyst, this is going to be valuable knowledge for your career. Coming up, we'll talk a bit more about these problem types and I'll provide even more examples of them being solved by data analysts. Personally, I love real-world examples. They really help me better understand new concepts. I can't wait to share even more actual cases with you. See you there.

# Six problem types
Data analytics is so much more than just plugging information into a platform to find insights. It is about solving problems. To get to the root of these problems and find practical solutions, there are lots of opportunities for creative thinking. No matter the problem, the first and most important step is understanding it. From there, it is good to take a problem-solver approach to your analysis to help you decide what information needs to be included, how you can transform the data, and how the data will be used.

Data analysts typically work with six problem types
This illustration shows a numbered list with six icons. Each icon represents one of the six problem types.1. Making predictions
2. Categorizing things
3. Spotting something unusual
4. Identifying themes
5. Discovering connections
6. Finding patterns
A  video, Common problem types, introduced the six problem types with an example for each. The examples are summarized below for review.

Making predictions
A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

Categorizing things
An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

Spotting something unusual
A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

Identifying themes
User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.

By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

Discovering connections
A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries.

Finding patterns
Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.

# SMART questions
Now that we've talked about six basic problem types, it's time to start solving them. To do that, data analysts start by asking the right questions. In this video, we're going to learn how to ask effective questions that lead to key insights you can use to solve all kinds of problems. As a data analyst, I ask questions constantly. It's a huge part of the job. If someone requests that I work on a project, I ask questions to make sure we're on the same page about the plan and the goals. And when I do get a result, I question it. Is the data showing me something superficially? Is there a conflict somewhere that needs to be resolved? The more questions you ask, the more you'll learn about your data and the more powerful your insights will be at the end of the day. Some questions are more effective than others. Let's say you're having lunch with a friend and they say, "These are the best sandwiches ever, aren't they?" Well, that question doesn't really give you the opportunity to share your own opinion, especially if you happen to disagree and didn't enjoy the sandwich very much. This is called a leading question because it's leading you to answer in a certain way. Or maybe you're working on a project and you decide to interview a family member. Say you ask your uncle, did you enjoy growing up in Malaysia? He may reply, "Yes." But you haven't learned much about his experiences there. Your question was closed-ended. That means it can be answered with a yes or no. These kinds of questions rarely lead to valuable insights. Now what if someone asks you, do you prefer chocolate or vanilla? Well, what are they specifically talking about? Ice cream, pudding, coffee flavoring or something else? What if you like chocolate ice cream but vanilla in your coffee? What if you don't like either flavor? That's the problem with this question. It's too vague and lacks context. Knowing the difference between effective and ineffective questions is essential for your future career as a data analyst. After all, the data analyst process starts with the ask phase. So it's important that we ask the right questions. Effective questions follow the SMART methodology. That means they're specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant and time-bound. Let's break that down. Specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. This helps us collect information that's relevant to what we're investigating. If a question is too general, try to narrow it down by focusing on just one element. For example, instead of asking a closed-ended question, like, are kids getting enough physical activities these days? Ask what percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week? That question is much more specific and can give you more useful information. Now, let's talk about measurable questions. Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed. An example of an unmeasurable question would be, why did a recent video go viral? Instead, you could ask how many times was our video shared on social channels the first week it was posted? That question is measurable because it lets us count the shares and arrive at a concrete number. Okay, now we've come to action-oriented questions. Action-oriented questions encourage change. You might remember that problem solving is about seeing the current state and figuring out how to transform it into the ideal future state. Well, action-oriented questions help you get there. So rather than asking, how can we get customers to recycle our product packaging? You could ask, what design features will make our packaging easier to recycle? This brings you answers you can act on. All right, let's move on to relevant questions. Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve. Let's say you're working on a problem related to a threatened species of frog. And you asked, why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing? This is an irrelevant question because the answer won't help us find a way to prevent these frogs from going extinct. A more relevant question would be, what environmental factors changed in Durham, North Carolina between 1983 and 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear from the Sandhills Regions? This question would give us answers we can use to help solve our problem. That's also a great example for our final point, time-bound questions. Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied. The time period we want to study is 1983 to 2004. This limits the range of possibilities and enables the data analyst to focus on relevant data. Okay, now that you have a general understanding of SMART questions, there's something else that's very important to keep in mind when crafting questions, fairness. We've touched on fairness before, but as a quick reminder, fairness means ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias. To talk about this, let's go back to our sandwich example. There we had an unfair question because it was phrased to lead you toward a certain answer. This made it difficult to answer honestly if you disagreed about the sandwich quality. Another common example of an unfair question is one that makes assumptions. For instance, let's say a satisfaction survey is given to people who visit a science museum. If the survey asks, what do you love most about our exhibits? This assumes that the customer loves the exhibits which may or may not be true. Fairness also means crafting questions that make sense to everyone. It's important for questions to be clear and have a straightforward wording that anyone can easily understand. Unfair questions also can make your job as a data analyst more difficult. They lead to unreliable feedback and missed opportunities to gain some truly valuable insights. You've learned a lot about how to craft effective questions, like how to use the SMART framework while creating your questions and how to ensure that your questions are fair and objective. Moving forward, you'll explore different types of data and learn how each is used to guide business decisions. You'll also learn more about visualizations and how metrics or measures can help create success. It's going to be great!

# More about SMART questions
Companies in lots of industries today are dealing with rapid change and rising uncertainty. Even well-established businesses are under pressure to keep up with what is new and figure out what is next. To do that, they need to ask questions. Asking the right questions can help spark the innovative ideas that so many businesses are hungry for these days.

The same goes for data analytics. No matter how much information you have or how advanced your tools are, your data won’t tell you much if you don’t start with the right questions. Think of it like a detective with tons of evidence who doesn’t ask a key suspect about it.  Coming up, you will learn more about how to ask highly effective questions, along with certain practices you want to avoid.

Highly effective questions are SMART questions:


Examples of SMART questions
Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: What features do people look for when buying a new car?

Specific: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?

Measurable: Does the question include a feature rating system?

Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?

Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?

Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years?

Questions should be open-ended. This is the best way to get responses that will help you accurately qualify or disqualify potential solutions to your specific problem. So, based on the thought process, possible SMART questions might be:

On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the most important) how important is your car having four-wheel drive?

What are the top five features you would like to see in a car package?

What features, if included with four-wheel drive, would make you more inclined to buy the car?

How much more would you pay for a car with four-wheel drive?

Has four-wheel drive become more or less popular in the last three years?

Things to avoid when asking questions
Leading questions: questions that only have a particular response

Example: This product is too expensive, isn’t it?

This is a leading question because it suggests an answer as part of the question. A better question might be, “What is your opinion of this product?” There are tons of answers to that question, and they could include information about usability, features, accessories, color, reliability, and popularity, on top of price. Now, if your problem is actually focused on pricing, you could ask a question like “What price (or price range) would make you consider purchasing this product?” This question would provide a lot of different measurable responses.

Closed-ended questions: questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only

Example: Were you satisfied with the customer trial?

This is a closed-ended question because it doesn’t encourage people to expand on their answer. It is really easy for them to give one-word responses that aren’t very informative. A better question might be, “What did you learn about customer experience from the trial.” This encourages people to provide more detail besides “It went well.”

Vague questions: questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

Example: Does the tool work for you?

This question is too vague because there is no context. Is it about comparing the new tool to the one it replaces? You just don’t know. A better inquiry might be, “When it comes to data entry, is the new tool faster, slower, or about the same as the old tool? If faster, how much time is saved? If slower, how much time is lost?” These questions give context (data entry) and help frame responses that are measurable (time).
