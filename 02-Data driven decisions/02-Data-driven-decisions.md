# Data and decisions
Welcome back. Now it's time to go even further and build on what you've learned about problem-solving in data analytics and crafting effective questions. Coming up, we'll cover a wide range of topics. You'll learn about how data can empower our decisions, big and small; the difference between quantitative and qualitative analysis and when to use them; the pros and cons of different data visualization tools; what metrics are, and how analysts use them; and how to use mathematical thinking to connect the dots. To be honest, I'm still learning more about these things every day, and so will you! Like how quantitative and qualitative data can work together. In my role in finance, most of my work is quantitative, but recently I was working on a project that focused a lot on empathy and trust and that was really new for me. But we took those more qualitative things into account during analysis, and that really helped me understand how quantitative and qualitative data can come together to help us make powerful decisions. Now you're on your way to building your own data analyst toolkit. Before you know it, you'll be analyzing all kinds of data yourself and learning new things while you do it. But first, let's start small with the power of observation.

# How data empowers decisions
We've talked a lot about what data is and how it plays into decision-making. What do we know already? Well, we know that data is a collection of facts. We also know that data analysis reveals important patterns and insights about that data. Finally, we know that data analysis can help us make more informed decisions. Now, we'll look at how data plays into the decision-making process and take a quick look at the differences between data-driven and data-inspired decisions. Let's look at a real-life example. Think about the last time you searched "restaurants near me" and sorted the results by rating to help you decide which one looks best. That was a decision you made using data. Businesses and other organizations use data to make better decisions all the time. There's two ways they can do this, with data-driven or data-inspired decision-making. We'll talk more about data-inspired decision-making later on, but here's a quick definition for now. Data-inspired decision-making explores different data sources to find out what they have in common. Here at Google, we use data every single day, in very surprising ways too. For example, we use data to help cut back on the amount of energy spent cooling your data centers. After analyzing years of data collected with artificial intelligence, we were able to make decisions that help reduce the energy we use to cool our data centers by over 40 percent. Google's People Operations team also uses data to improve how we hire new Googlers and how we get them started on the right foot. We wanted to make sure we weren't passing over any talented applicants and that we made their transition into their new roles as smooth as possible. After analyzing data on applications, interviews, and new hire orientation processes, we started using an algorithm. An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task. With this algorithm, we reviewed applicants that didn't pass the initial screening process to find great candidates. Data also helped us determine the ideal number of interviews that lead to the best possible hiring decisions. We've created new onboarding agendas to help new employees get started at their new jobs. Data is everywhere. Today, we create so much data that scientists estimate 90 percent of the world's data has been created in just the last few years. Think of the potential here. The more data we have, the bigger the problems we can solve and the more powerful our solutions can be. But responsibly gathering data is only part of the process. We also have to turn data into knowledge that helps us make better solutions. I'm going to let fellow Googler, Ed, talk more about that. Just having tons of data isn't enough. We have to do something meaningful with it. Data in itself provides little value. To quote Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and Square, "Every single action that we do in this world is triggering off some amount of data, and most of that data is meaningless until someone adds some interpretation of it or someone adds a narrative around it." Data is straightforward, facts collected together, values that describe something. Individual data points become more useful when they're collected and structured, but they're still somewhat meaningless by themselves. We need to interpret data to turn it into information. Look at Michael Phelps' time in a 200-meter individual medal swimming race, one minute, 54 seconds. Doesn't tell us much. When we compare it to his competitor's times in the race, however, we can see that Michael came in the first place and won the gold medal. Our analysis took data, in this case, a list of Michael's races and times and turned it into information by comparing it with other data. Context is important. We needed to know that this race was an Olympic final and not some other random race to determine that this was a gold medal finish. But this still isn't knowledge. When we consume information, understand it, and apply it, that's when data is most useful. In other words, Michael Phelps is a fast swimmer. It's pretty cool how we can turn data into knowledge that helps us in all kinds of ways, whether it's finding the perfect restaurant or making environmentally friendly changes. But keep in mind, there are limitations to data analytics. Sometimes we don't have access to all of the data we need, or data is measured differently across programs, which can make it difficult to find concrete examples. We'll cover these more in detail later on, but it's important that you start thinking about them now. Now that you know how data drives decision-making, you know how key your role as a data analyst is to the business. Data is a powerful tool for decision-making, and you can help provide businesses with the information they need to solve problems and make new decisions, but before that, you will need to learn a little more about the kinds of data you'll be working with and how to deal with it.

# Data trials and triumphs
This reading focuses on why accurate interpretation of data is key to data-driven decisions. You have been learning why data is such a powerful business tool and how data analysts help their companies make data-driven decisions for great results. As a quick reminder, the goal of all data analysts is to use data to draw accurate conclusions and make good recommendations. That all starts with having complete, correct, and relevant data.

This illustration shows a magnifying glass viewing binary numbers and the word ERROR.
But keep in mind, it is possible to have solid data and still make the wrong choices. It is up to data analysts to interpret the data accurately. When data is interpreted incorrectly, it can lead to huge losses. Consider the examples below.

Coke launch failure
In 1985, New Coke was launched, replacing the classic Coke formula. The company had done taste tests with 200,000 people and found that test subjects preferred the taste of New Coke over Pepsi, which had become a tough competitor. Based on this data alone, classic Coke was taken off the market and replaced with New Coke. This was seen as the solution to take back the market share that had been lost to Pepsi.

But as it turns out, New Coke was a massive flop and the company ended up losing tens of millions of dollars. How could this have happened with data that seemed correct? It is because the data wasn’t complete, which made it inaccurate. The data didn't consider how customers would feel about New Coke replacing classic Coke. The company’s decision to retire classic Coke was a data-driven decision based on incomplete data.

Mars orbiter loss
In 1999, NASA lost the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter, even though it had good data. The spacecraft burned to pieces because of poor collaboration and communication. The Orbiter’s navigation team was using the SI or metric system (newtons) for their force calculations, but the engineers who built the spacecraft used the English Engineering Units system (pounds) for force calculations.

No one realized a problem even existed until the Orbiter burst into flames in the Martian atmosphere. Later, a NASA review board investigating the root cause of the problem figured out that the issue was isolated to the software that controlled the thrusters. One program calculated the thrusters’ force in pounds; another program looking at the data assumed it was in newtons. The software controllers were making data-driven decisions to adjust the thrust based on 100% accurate data, but these decisions were wrong because of inaccurate assumptions when interpreting it. A conversion of the data from one system of measurement to the other could have prevented the loss.

This illustration shows a file icon with a checkmark to the right.
When data is used strategically, businesses can transform and grow their revenue. Consider the examples below.

Crate and Barrel
At Crate and Barrel, online sales jumped more than 40% during stay-at-home orders to combat the global pandemic. Currently, online sales make up more than 65% of their overall business. They are using data insights to accelerate their digital transformation and bring the best of online and offline experiences together for customers.

BigQuery enables Crate and Barrel to "draw on ten times [as many] information sources (compared to a few years ago) which are then analyzed and transformed into actionable insights that can be used to influence the customer’s next interaction. And this, in turn, drives revenue."

Read more about Crate and Barrel's data strategy in How one retailer’s data strategy powers seamless customer experiences.

PepsiCo
Since the days of the New Coke launch, things have changed dramatically for beverage and other consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies.

PepsiCo "hired analytical talent and established cross-functional workflows around an infrastructure designed to put consumers’ needs first. Then [they] set up the right processes to make critical decisions based on data and technology use cases. Finally, [they] invested in the right technology stack and platforms so that data could flow into a central cloud-based hub. This is critical. When data comes together, [they] develop a holistic understanding of the consumer and their journeys."

Read about how PepsiCo is delivering a more personal and valuable experience to customers using data in How one of the world’s biggest marketers ripped up its playbook and learned to anticipate intent.

Key skills for triumphant results
As a data analyst, your own skills and knowledge will be the most important part of any analysis project. It is important for you to keep a data-driven mindset, ask lots of questions, experiment with many different possibilities, and use both logic and creativity along the way. You will then be prepared to interpret your data with the highest levels of care and accuracy. Note that there is a difference between making a decision with incomplete data and making a decision with a small amount of data. You learned that making a decision with incomplete data is dangerous. But sometimes accurate data from a small test can help you make a good decision. Stay tuned. You will learn about how much data to collect later in the program.

# Qualitative and quantitative data
Hi again. When it comes to decision-making, data is key. But we've also learned that there are a lot of different kinds of questions that data might help us answer, and these different questions make different kinds of data. There are two kinds of data that we'll talk about in this video, quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can often be the what, how many, and how often about a problem. In other words, things you can measure, like how many commuters take the train to work every week. As a financial analyst, I work with a lot of quantitative data. I love the certainty and accuracy of numbers. On the other hand, qualitative data describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your hair color. Qualitative data is great for helping us answer why questions. For example, why people might like a certain celebrity or snack food more than others. With quantitative data, we can see numbers visualized as charts or graphs. Qualitative data can then give us a more high-level understanding of why the numbers are the way they are. This is important because it helps us add context to a problem. As a data analyst, you'll be using both quantitative and qualitative analysis, depending on your business task. Reviews are a great example of this. Think about a time you used reviews to decide whether you wanted to buy something or go somewhere. These reviews might have told you how many people dislike that thing and why. Businesses read these reviews too, but they use the data in different ways. Let's look at an example of a business using data from customer reviews to see qualitative and quantitative data in action. Now, say a local ice cream shop has started using their online reviews to engage with their customers and build their brand. These reviews give the ice cream shop insights into their customers' experiences, which they can use to inform their decision-making. The owner notices that their rating has been going down. He sees that lately his shop has been receiving more negative reviews. He wants to know why, so he starts asking questions. First are measurable questions. How many negative reviews are there? What's the average rating? How many of these reviews use the same keywords? These questions generate quantitative data, numerical results that help confirm their customers aren't satisfied. This data might lead them to ask different questions. Why are customers unsatisfied? How can we improve their experience? These are questions that lead to qualitative data. After looking through the reviews, the ice cream shop owner sees a pattern, 17 of negative reviews use the word "frustrated." That's quantitative data. Now we can start collecting qualitative data by asking why this word is being repeated? He finds that customers are frustrated because the shop is running out of popular flavors before the end of the day. Knowing this, the ice cream shop can change its weekly order to make sure it has enough of what the customers want. With both quantitative and qualitative data, the ice cream shop owner was able to figure out his customers were unhappy and understand why. Having both types of data made it possible for him to make the right changes and improve his business. Now that you know the difference between quantitative and qualitative data, you know how to get different types of data by asking different questions. It's your job as a data detective to know which questions to ask to find the right solution. Then you can start thinking about cool and creative ways to help stakeholders better understand the data. For example, interactive dashboards, which we'll learn about soon.

# Qualitative and quantitative data in business
This reading further elaborates on the meaning of qualitative versus quantitative.

As you have learned, there are two types of data: qualitative and quantitative.

This illustration shows two silhouettes looking at each other and qualitative and quantitative data tools in two columns.Qualitative data tools: focus groups, social media text analysis, and in-person interviews

Quantitative data tools: structured interviews, surveys, and polls
We can take a closer look at the data types and data collection tools. Imagine that you are a data analyst for a chain of movie theaters. Your manager wants you to track trends in:

Movie attendance over time

Profitability of the concession stand

Evening audience preferences

In our scenario, we assume quantitative data already exists to monitor all three trends.

Movie attendance over time
Image of a progress measuring meter
Starting with the historical data the theater has through its loyalty and rewards program, your first step is to investigate what insights you can gain from that data. You look at attendance over the last 3 months. But, because the last 3 months didn’t include a major holiday, you decide it is better to look at a full year’s worth of data. As you suspected, the quantitative data confirmed that average attendance was 550 per month but then rose to an average of 1,600 per month for the months with holidays.

The historical data serves your needs for the project, but you also decide that you will resume the analysis again in a few months after the theater increases ticket prices for evening showtimes.

Profitability of the concession stand
Image of a stack of money and coins. There is a clock in the background
Profit is calculated by subtracting cost from sales revenue. The historical data shows that while the concession stand was profitable, profit margins were razor thin at less than 5%. You saw that average purchases totaled $20 or less. You decide that you will keep monitoring this on an ongoing basis.

Based on your understanding of data collection tools, you will suggest an online survey of customers so they can comment on the food at the concession stand. This will enable you to gather even more quantitative data to revamp the menu and potentially increase profits.

Evening audience preferences
Image of a person sitting across a group of people
Your analysis of the historical data shows that the 7:30 PM showtime was the most popular and had the greatest attendance, followed by the 7:15 PM and 9:00 PM showtimes. You may suggest replacing the current 8:00 PM showtime that has lower attendance with an 8:30 PM showtime. But you need more data to back up your hunch that people would be more likely to attend the later show.

Evening movie-goers are the largest source of revenue for the theater. Therefore, you also decide to include a question in your online survey to gain more insight.

Qualitative data for all three trends plus ticket pricing
Since you know that the theater is planning to raise ticket prices for evening showtimes in a few months, you will also include a question in the survey to get an idea of customers’ price sensitivity.

Your final online survey might include these questions for qualitative data:

What went into your decision to see a movie in our theater today? (movie attendance)

What do you think about the quality and value of your purchases at the concession stand? (concession stand profitability)

Which showtime do you prefer, 8:00 PM or 8:30 PM, and why do you prefer that time? (evening movie-goer preferences)

Under what circumstances would you choose a matinee over a nighttime showing? (ticket price increase)

Summing it up
Data analysts will generally use both types of data in their work. Usually, qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation. In other words, quantitative data generally gives you the what, and qualitative data generally gives you the why. By using both quantitative and qualitative data, you can learn when people like to go to the movies and why they chose the theater. Maybe they really like the reclining chairs, so your manager can purchase more recliners. Maybe the theater is the only one that serves root beer. Maybe a later show time gives them more time to drive to the theater from where popular restaurants are located. Maybe they go to matinees because they have kids and want to save money. You wouldn’t have discovered this information by analyzing only the quantitative data for attendance, profit, and showtimes.

# Learning Log: Ask SMART questions about real-life data sources

Overview

In a previous self-reflection, you prepared for a “data conversation” with someone in your life by creating SMART questions to help you understand more about the data they usually interact with, the limitations of the data they have, and their business goals. Now, you’ll complete an entry in your learning log to reflect on that conversation and how you might approach this data for a real project. By the time you complete this log entry, you will have a stronger understanding of how to use the SMART framework to craft effective questions about real life data. This will be a key skill as you begin to develop your own data analysis projects.

Review your notes

Before you begin your new entry, take a moment to locate and read the notes you took during your data conversation. Based on the answers to your well-prepared SMART questions, you should have a better context for your target audience now. Review those answers and start thinking about the following:

Stakeholder’s business goals; in this case, the person you had a conversation with

Identifying the data needed to answer the SMART questions

Exploring what data the stakeholder already has

Determining the data that you don’t have, but need in order to answer the questions

You’ll reflect on how your data conversation went and what you learned in your learning log template which is linked below.

Reflection

Write 5-7 sentences (100-140 words) about data sources discussed during your real-life data conversation.

First, consider your data conversation and how it went. Here are some questions to help you get started:

Was there anything challenging about getting the conversation started?

Were there questions you didn’t get to ask?

Did you manage your time effectively?

Did you take notes? Are they as detailed as you need them to be?

Are you missing any information? Is there anything that you still find unclear or vague?  

If you could do the conversation over again, is there anything you would change?

Next, turn your attention to your notes and reflect on what you know about the data itself:

What are the sources of data available for the project?

Which data sources were qualitative and which were quantitative? Explain your answer.

What decisions could you make when considering each data source separately? Could you make different decisions about the data if you combined it? If so, give an example.

Is there any kind of data that isn’t available, but you would like to find? If so, what is it, and why would you like to know more about it?

When you’ve finished your entry in the learning log template, make sure to save the document so your response is somewhere accessible. This will help you continue applying data analysis to your everyday life. You will also be able to track your progress and growth as a data analyst.

# The big reveal: Sharing your findings
Data is great, but if we can't communicate the story data is telling, it isn't useful to anyone. We need ways to organize data that help us turn it into information. There are all kinds of tools out there to help you visualize and share your data analysis with stakeholders. Here, we'll talk about two data presentation tools, reports and dashboards. Reports and dashboards are both useful for data visualization. But there are pros and cons for each of them. A report is a static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically. A dashboard on the other hand, monitors live, incoming data. Let's talk about reports first. Reports are great for giving snapshots of high level historical data for an organization. For example, a finance firm's monthly sales. Reports come with a lot of benefits too. They can be designed and sent out periodically, often on a weekly or monthly basis, as organized and easy to reference information. They're quick to design and easy to use as long as you continually maintain them. Finally, because reports use static data or data that doesn't change once it's been recorded, they reflect data that's already been cleaned and sorted. There are some downsides to keep in mind too. Reports need regular maintenance and aren't very visually appealing. Because they aren't automatic or dynamic, reports don't show live, evolving data. For a live reflection of incoming data, you'll want to design a dashboard. Dashboards are great for a lot of reasons, they give your team more access to information being recorded, you can interact through data by playing with filters, and because they're dynamic, they have long-term value. If stakeholders need to continually access information, a dashboard can be more efficient than having to pull reports over and over, which is a big time saver for you. Last but not least, they're just nice to look at. But dashboards do have some cons too. For one thing, they take a lot of time to design and can actually be less efficient than reports, if they're not used very often. If the base table breaks at any point, they need a lot of maintenance to get back up and running again. Dashboards can sometimes overwhelm people with information too. If you aren't used to looking through data on a dashboard, you might get lost in it. As a data analyst, you need to decide the best way to communicate information to your stakeholders. For example, what if your stakeholders are interested in the company's social media engagement? Would a monthly report that tells them the number of new followers for their page be useful? Or a dashboard that monitors live social media engagement across multiple platforms? Later on, you'll create your own reports and dashboards to practice using these tools. But for now, I want to show you what a report and a dashboard might look like. We'll start by using a tool we're already familiar with, spreadsheets. Let's see one way spreadsheet data could be visualized in a report. This spreadsheet has a data set with order details from a wholesale company. That's a lot of information. From the headers, we can see different things recorded here, like the order date, the salesperson, the unit price, and revenue for each transaction recorded. It's all useful information, but a little hard to wrap your head around. We want a report that's easier to read. Let's say your stakeholders want a quick look at the revenue by salesperson. Using the data, you could make them a pivot table with a graph that shows that information. A pivot table is a data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, re-organize, group, count, total, or average data stored in a database. It allows its users to transform columns into rows and rows into columns. We'll actually learn more about pivot tables later. But I'll show you one really quick. We'll select the Data menu and click Pivot table button. It can pull data from this table. We can just press create and it'll pull up a new worksheet. Over here, it gives us the pivot table fields we can choose from. Click select, salesperson and revenue. Just like that, it made a chart for us. At this point, you can play around with how the graph looks, but the information is all there. Let's move on to dashboards. If you need a more dynamic way to share information with your stakeholders, dashboards are your friend. You might create something like this Tableau dashboard. With interactive graphs that showcase multiple views of the data. With this, users can change location, date range, or any other aspect of the data they're viewing by clicking through different elements on the dashboard. Pretty cool, right? Later in this program, we'll look into how you can make your own data visualizations. We have a lot to learn before we get to that. But I hope this was an exciting first peek at the different visualization tools you'll be using as a data analyst.

# Data versus metric
In the last video, we learned how you can visualize your data using reports and dashboards to show off your findings in interesting ways. In one of our examples, the company wanted to see the sales revenue of each salesperson. That specific measurement of data is done using metrics. Now, I want to tell you a little bit more about the difference between data and metrics. And how metrics can be used to turn data into useful information.
Play video starting at ::30 and follow transcript0:30
A metric is a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. Think of it this way. Data starts as a collection of raw facts, until we organize them into individual metrics that represent a single type of data.
Play video starting at ::48 and follow transcript0:48
Metrics can also be combined into formulas that you can plug your numerical data into. In our earlier sales revenue example all that data doesn't mean much unless we use a specific metric to organize it. So let's use revenue by individual salesperson as our metric. Now we can see whose sales brought in the highest revenue. Metrics usually involve simple math. Revenue, for example, is the number of sales multiplied by the sales price. Choosing the right metric is key.
Play video starting at :1:25 and follow transcript1:25
Data contains a lot of raw details about the problem we're exploring. But we need the right metrics to get the answers we're looking for. Different industries will use all kinds of metrics to measure things in a data set. Let's look at some more ways businesses in different industries use metrics. So you can see how you might apply metrics to your collected data.
Play video starting at :1:50 and follow transcript1:50
Ever heard of ROI?
Play video starting at :1:53 and follow transcript1:53
Companies use this metric all the time. ROI, or Return on Investment is essentially a formula designed using metrics that let a business know how well an investment is doing. The ROI is made up of two metrics, the net profit over a period of time and the cost of investment. By comparing these two metrics, profit and cost of investment, the company can analyze the data they have to see how well their investment is doing. This can then help them decide how to invest in the future and which investments to prioritize. We see metrics used in marketing too. For example, metrics can be used to help calculate customer retention rates, or a company's ability to keep its customers over time. Customer retention rates can help the company compare the number of customers at the beginning and the end of a period to see their retention rates. This way the company knows how successful their marketing strategies are and if they need to research new approaches to bring back more repeat customers.
Play video starting at :3:3 and follow transcript3:03
Different industries use all kinds of different metrics. But there's one thing they all have in common: they're all trying to meet a specific goal by measuring data.
Play video starting at :3:14 and follow transcript3:14
This metric goal is a measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics. And just like there are a lot of possible metrics, there are lots of possible goals too.
Play video starting at :3:26 and follow transcript3:26
Maybe an organization wants to meet a certain number of monthly sales, or maybe a certain percentage of repeat customers.
Play video starting at :3:34 and follow transcript3:34
By using metrics to focus on individual aspects of your data, you can start to see the story your data is telling. Metric goals and formulas are great ways to measure and understand data. But they're not the only ways. We'll talk more about how to interpret and understand data throughout this course.

# Mathematical thinking
So far, you've learned a lot about how to think like a data analyst. We've explored a few different ways of thinking. And now, I want to take that one step further by using a mathematical approach to problem-solving. Mathematical thinking is a powerful skill you can use to help you solve problems and see new solutions. So, let's take some time to talk about what mathematical thinking is, and how you can start using it. Using a mathematical approach doesn't mean you have to suddenly become a math whiz. It means looking at a problem and logically breaking it down step-by-step, so you can see the relationship of patterns in your data, and use that to analyze your problem. This kind of thinking can also help you figure out the best tools for analysis because it lets us see the different aspects of a problem and choose the best logical approach. There are a lot of factors to consider when choosing the most helpful tool for your analysis. One way you could decide which tool to use is by the size of your dataset. When working with data, you'll find that there's big and small data. Small data can be really small. These kinds of data tend to be made up of datasets concerned with specific metrics over a short, well defined period of time. Like how much water you drink in a day. Small data can be useful for making day-to-day decisions, like deciding to drink more water. But it doesn't have a huge impact on bigger frameworks like business operations. You might use spreadsheets to organize and analyze smaller datasets when you first start out. Big data on the other hand has larger, less specific datasets covering a longer period of time. They usually have to be broken down to be analyzed. Big data is useful for looking at large- scale questions and problems, and they help companies make big decisions. When you're working with data on this larger scale, you might switch to SQL. Let's look at an example of how a data analyst working in a hospital might use mathematical thinking to solve a problem with the right tools. The hospital might find that they're having a problem with over or under use of their beds. Based on that, the hospital could make bed optimization a goal. They want to make sure that beds are available to patients who need them, but not waste hospital resources like space or money on maintaining empty beds. Using mathematical thinking, you can break this problem down into a step-by-step process to help you find patterns in their data. There's a lot of variables in this scenario. But for now, let's keep it simple and focus on just a few key ones. There are metrics that are related to this problem that might show us patterns in the data: for example, maybe the number of beds open and the number of beds used over a period of time. There's actually already a formula for this. It's called the bed occupancy rate, and it's calculated using the total number of inpatient days, and the total number of available beds over a given period of time. What we want to do now is take our key variables and see how their relationship to each other might show us patterns that can help the hospital make a decision. To do that, we have to choose the tool that makes sense for this task. Hospitals generate a lot of patient data over a long period of time. So logically, a tool that's capable of handling big datasets is a must. SQL is a great choice. In this case, you discover that the hospital always has unused beds. Knowing that, they can choose to get rid of some beds, which saves them space and money that they can use to buy and store protective equipment. By considering all of the individual parts of this problem logically, mathematical thinking helped us see new perspectives that led us to a solution. Well, that's it for now. Great job. You've covered a lot of material already. You've learned about how empowering data can be in decision-making, the difference between quantitative and qualitative analysis, using reports and dashboards for data visualization, metrics, and using a mathematical approach to problem-solving. Coming up next, we'll be tackling spreadsheet basics. You'll get to put what you've learned into action and learn a new tool to help you along the data analysis process. See you soon.

# Big and small data
As a data analyst, you will work with data both big and small. Both kinds of data are valuable, but they play very different roles.

Image of two gears, one small and one large. Each gear has a person icon inside
Whether you work with big or small data, you can use it to help stakeholders improve business processes, answer questions, create new products, and much more. But there are certain challenges and benefits that come with big data and the following table explores the differences between big and small data.

                                    Small data

Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses

Likely to be used by large organizations

Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent

Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent

Usually already a manageable size for analysis

Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making

Challenges and benefits
Here are some challenges you might face when working with big data:

A lot of organizations deal with data overload and way too much unimportant or irrelevant information.

Important data can be hidden deep down with all of the non-important data, which makes it harder to find and use. This can lead to slower and more inefficient decision-making time frames.

The data you need isn’t always easily accessible.

Current technology tools and solutions still struggle to provide measurable and reportable data. This can lead to unfair algorithmic bias.

There are gaps in many big data business solutions.

Now for the good news! Here are some benefits that come with big data:

When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.

Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new products and solutions that will make customers happy.

By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.

As in our earlier social media example, big data helps companies keep track of their online presence—especially feedback, both good and bad, from customers. This gives them the information they need to improve and protect their brand.

The three (or four) V words for big data
When thinking about the benefits and challenges of big data, it helps to think about the three Vs: volume, variety, and velocity. Volume describes the amount of data. Variety describes the different kinds of data. Velocity describes how fast the data can be processed. Some data analysts also consider a fourth V: veracity. Veracity refers to the quality and reliability of the data. These are all important considerations related to processing huge, complex data sets.
